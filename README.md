## üëΩ Who am I?

Hello, my name is Daniel Horvath. I'm Brazilian and studying Systems Analysis and Development. I'm a curious person who wants to learn and participate in the development of creative projects! I've been immersed in the world of technology and computing since I was 10 years old, and I never want to let go. I'm not afraid of technology and believe that science will liberate humanity.

## üéØ My skills and projects

I'm actively developing my expertise in **Python** across various domains, from data analysis to backend development. My projects are my learning playground, where I focus on writing clean, effective code and following best practices.

## üöÄ My future

My curiosity drives me towards the cutting edge of technology. I'm building a strong foundation now to actively contribute to the fields of intelligent systems and automation in the future. Technologies I want to learn soon:

*   **ü§ñ Machine Learning & AI:** I'm fascinated by how machines can learn from data. My goal is to understand the math behind the magic and learn to build models that can predict, classify, and create.
*   **ü¶æ Robotics:** I want to move beyond pure code and make things happen in the physical world. I aim to learn about ROS (Robot Operating System), control systems, and how to program robots to perceive and interact with their environment.
*   **‚òÅÔ∏è MLOps & Cloud:** Turning a model into a real-world application is a challenge I want to master, using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud services.
*   **üìä Advanced Data Science:** Going beyond the basics to master statistical learning and feature engineering to build more powerful and accurate models.
